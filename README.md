  Clothes Store

</h1>

<h4 align="center">This is a simple iOS app demonstrating an online store.</h4>

## Requirements

> This app uses Cocoapods to install some dependencies that the project uses, in particular:

* RxSwift - for Reactive components
* RxCocoa - for Reactive UI
* Alamofire - for networking

## Additional information

> Some of the API calls do not work as expected (API issues not network calls from app).
